# EPL-Football-Data


Project Overview

In this project, we'll scrape the data for football(soccer) matches in the English Premier League (EPL) from FBref which provides in-depth stats for all matches. 

After obtaining the data from the web, we'll use machine learning to predict the winners of football matches in the English Premier League.


Project Steps

Data for matches is scraped and downloaded using requests and BeautifulSoup in Python.

Then, pandas is used to parse and clean the data. 

After parsing and cleaning, the data is cleaned get it ready for machine learning using pandas.

Predictions are made about who will win a match using scikit-learn.

After creating the model, we measure error and improve our predictions.
